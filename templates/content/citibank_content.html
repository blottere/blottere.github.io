            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            Citibank India app suffers from a lack of simplicity in user interaction. Each task was buried within a complex network of navigations giving rise to a tedious user experience.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            This new design aims to make the user interaction more fluid by making relevant information readily accessible to the user through a simple and intuitive experience.
        </p>

        <h4>My Process</h4>
        <p>
            I took up this personal project during my free time when I was hunting for a good short term UX design project to work on. Back then Citibank was my primary account holder, and I always found myself struggling with their mobile interface. I continuously found myself lost between pages and unable to complete my tasks which are all the more frustrating when time is limited. I felt that the application could do much better for the user. The problem space was like an itch I had to scratch, and I was excited to see what I could come up with.
        </p>

        <h4>Understanding the users</h4>
        <p>
            I began the process by talking to two sets of user groups ranging from ages of 21 to 60.
        </p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>
                The first set comprised of the CitiBank India application users since I needed to validate my experience against the experiences of other users to get a better perspective on how the CitiBank interface was perceived.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second set comprised of people who used other banking applications. Talking to this set of users helped me understand how users used banking applications and what their expectations were.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I also dug through other banking applications that usually received good reviews and ratings on play store, to understand the pros and cons of their design decisions. This provided me with a good base to start off from.
        </p>
        <h4>Turning the research</h4>
        <p>
            I synthesized my research through a round of mind mapping and drew specific insights that drove my design decisions for the application. I followed with several phases of sketching where I explored concepts and iterated on different ideas. I was experimenting with various possibilities of navigating through the interface, trying to simplify the actions taken to complete each task phase.
        </p>
        <h4>First phase of validation</h4>
        <p>
            As the ideas developed, I created several versions of user interaction flow sketches and tested user responses. I felt that involving the users during the preliminary concept phase would help me simplify the interactions and improve the quality of the experience. This activity helped me iterate actively during the testing process and helped me shape up the design.
        </p>
        <h4>Second phase of validation</h4>
            <p>
                The first phase of testing iterations led me to sketch a simpler set of navigations than before and helped me bring together a cleaner structure to the interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the second phase of testing, I was looking to
            </p>
            <ul class="bullets">
                <li>
                    Test the Navigation Drawer for crowding and overwhelming information
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transparency of the interface
                </li>
                <li>
                    Validate the ease of navigation between the pages
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            I tested the usability of the interface again with two more users from which I drew more distinct design recommendations. I removed a couple of unwanted interactions and added collapsible functionalities to each primary task within the navigation drawer to keep it clean and easily viewable.
        </p>
        <h4>Wireframe of the interace</h4>
        <p>

            <div class="image-sub">Wireframe of the re-designed interface</div>
        </p>
        <h4>Visualizing the design</h4>
        <p>
            As fun personal projects go, I was pretty proud of the progress I made with the design. My next step is to build a high-fidelity prototype to conduct usability tests with a larger user group and to understand the effectiveness of the design better.
        </p>
        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li> It is easy to fall back on your assumptions and personal preferences while designing an application you regularly use. The key is to separate that experience, compare it against the experiences of the larger user group and design for that.
            </li>
            <li>Creating beautiful experiences takes a good team work. But if you don't have a team working with you then users can help you fill that gap and explore the design possibilities.
            </li>
            <li>Feedback and criticism can come from anywhere and can help you make a huge leap in your design decisions.
            </li>
        </ul>
