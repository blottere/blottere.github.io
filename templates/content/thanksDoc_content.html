            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>The public assumes doctors as leading a cut above average lives, whereas, in reality, most doctors are overworked, sleep-deprived and steeped in a work culture that demands that they suck it up and show no weakness. Young doctors, mainly resident doctors, work an average of 80 hours per week, at the expense of their own mental and physiological wellness to see their patients go home completely cured.</p>

            <p>Yet, there is no efficient way for them to receive timely feedback of a job well done directly from their patients. The current method of hospital service feedbacks is a convoluted and impersonal form of survey system that doctors receive after several months. The lack of positive reinforcement negatively affects the performance and mental health of doctors.</p>

            <h3>Solution</h3>
            <p><bigWord>ThanksDoc</bigWord> is a platform that robustly connects patients to their doctors to provide patient appreciation directly to the doctors in (near) real-time. The goal of ThanksDoc is to motivate doctors actively on a daily basis helping them relieve their mental pressures and tackle their challenging days in a happier state of mind.

            <h4>Finding the Right User Group</h4>

            <p>We initially conducted semi-structured interviews with five doctors of different age groups, levels of expertise and experience to understand their work patterns based on the hierarchy within the medical field. We were able to recognize <bigWord>resident doctors and interns</bigWord> as the segment who operated under the highest amount of stress, longest work hours and sometimes sleepless nights. Our findings showed that this group was also highly volatile and susceptible to depression because they felt they <strong>‘needed to prove themselves'</strong>.</p>

        <div class="cols_66">
            <h4>Finding the Main Problem</h4>

            <p>We engaged in a rigorous exercise of mind mapping of our research data where we recognized recurrent themes in pain points that were prevalent in the young resident doctors. There were several problematic areas, but we were trying to find factors that mainly affected the mental happiness of doctors. The question we kept going back to was</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p class="quote">“What caused the doctors to burn out the way they did so frequently?”</p>

    <div class="image-sub">Mind Mapping our Research Data</div>

    <div class="image-grid">
        <div class="cols_66"><p>Mind Mapping helped us make sense of our research and derive insights that would focus our design.</p>

            <p>In the beginning, we focused on the insights and tried to decide on what problem needed our attention the most. We had different design ideas that could potentially solve each problem. After going through several rounds of discussion, we felt like we were caught in a vicious loop of self-interest and decided to take a step back. We engaged in another set of user interviews with two more doctors from our user group and validated some of our design ideas. We gained a clearer perspective and were then able to dump some of our ideas and develop others.</p>

            <p>The key insight that we gained was that the <strong>success of patient care</strong> is directly related to the <strong>mental health of a doctor</strong>. A doctor’s satisfaction, motivation and happiness depend on knowing that they are making a difference in people’s lives through their efforts.</p>

            <h4>Ideation</h4>
            <p>We jumped into a round of quick <bigWord>Round Robin Sketching</bigWord> where we explored different ways in which we could bring patient appreciations directly to the doctors. By the end of the sketching round, we had a variety of different approaches using artifacts, wearables and even embedded technology. They all seemed well thought out, creative and computer imaginative, but we weren’t sure if we were working within the constraints of convenience and accessibility for doctors.</p>
            </div>
    </div>
    <div class="quote">Why, how and when would the doctors use them? Were they non-intrusive and easily accessible? Would they be effective?</div>

    <div class="image-grid">
        <div class="cols_66">
    <p>These were big questions we needed to answer. We could do an elaborate usability test of course, but we didn’t feel quite ready yet.</p>

            <h4>Participatory Design</h4>

            <p>We took our design sketches and visited the Bloomington Hospital in downtown Bloomington, Indiana. With their permission, we observed the ER doctors as they worked, visited the doctors’ rooms, their lounge, and their workstations that they use to discuss patient progress and file documentation. We spoke to the Director of ER, about life as a resident doctor and involved few of the other ER doctors in a brainstorming session to get an idea about the most accessible technologies for them. We began understanding how an average day works for doctors and at what point we could embed the interaction for it to work smoothly.</p>

            <p>This also opened our eyes to different ways in which doctors could easily interact with technology without being pulled away from their valuable work time. Our focus was to integrate the positive experience seamlessly into their daily routine.</p>

            <h4>Design Concept</h4>
            <p>As a team, we first identified the doctor's <bigWord>common workstation</bigWord> as the best place to embed our experience at Bloomington Hospital. I then used our persona Dr. Dev Gupta, a first year attending physician at Bloomington Hospital to help me build a narrative of the experience.</p>

            <p>The first part of the experience would involve a well placed, optimally sized gratitude board that rotates the day’s appreciation messages to the doctors or a team of doctors and can be passively viewed even from a distance, without violating HIPPAA regulations and rules. The gratitude board aims to encourage, motivate and promote team bonding and community celebration between doctors since a team of doctors are actively involved in individual patient care.</p>

            <h4>Usability Testing the interface</h4>

            <p>We conducted preliminary interface usability tests with two doctors using paper prototypes to validate the ease of use of the interface and iterated our design based on the observations.</p>

            <p>We then created a high-fidelity prototype and conducted another set of usability tests with two more doctors for all the phases - the gratitude board and the email interactions (mobile and desktop) of the application.</p>
